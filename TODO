should have helper methods in dataset that get installed into examples
add ability to name custom models - see code below
clear all dumps on new run of tests
be sure we are capturing a dataset if it has already be captured before during a run
describe what happens when someone has a fixtures file - they get loaded after our datasets, thereby causing all the data in the table of the fixture file (like things.yml) to be deleted - the fixtures are then loaded
look into truncating database instead individual table deletes
allow configuration of dataset
  * permatable / global scope

  module Scenarios
    module TableMethods
      # TODO Move to Scenarios plugin to support naming custom models
      def name_model(model, symbolic_name)
        table_config.update_table_readers(CustomModel.new(model, symbolic_name))
        self.extend table_config.table_readers
      end

      class CustomModel
        attr_reader :model, :record_meta, :symbolic_name
        delegate :id, :to => :model

        def initialize(model, symbolic_name)
          @model         = model
          @record_meta   = Scenarios::TableMethods::RecordMeta.new(model.class.base_class)
          @symbolic_name = symbolic_name
        end

        def to_model
          @model
        end
      end
    end

      More(:a,:b)       Another(:a)
      
      
      
Something  {:a}         (:a).load
More       {:a,:b}      (:b).load
Another    {:a}         (:b).unload  (restore :a)

This can be confusing. Refer to documentation of 'superset' on wikipedia
{:a}.superset?({:a,:b})

Something.superclass?(More)


definition of test classes where dataset usage is declared
running the tests, at which point we must extend the instances to have the data reading methods, creation methods
  during the run, the test methods should have access to the data that was created
