make the dataset method available to tests (test/unit first, then rspec)
find datasets in some directory
get the test runners to load datasets at the right time
getting data reading methods available to tests
getting datasets able to 'use' other datasets


Dataset::Session.new
describe Something do
  dataset :a
  
  it 'should whatever'
  end
  
  describe More do
    dataset :b
    
    it 'should'
    end
  end
  
  describe Another do
    it 'should'
    end
  end
  
end

Dataset::Session.new
describe Something do
  dataset :a
  
  it 'should whatever'
  end
  
  describe More do
    dataset :b
    
    it 'should'
    end
  end
  
  describe Another do
    it 'should'
    end
  end
  
end


            Something(:a)
            
      More(:a,:b)       Another(:a)
      
      
      
Something  {:a}         (:a).load
More       {:a,:b}      (:b).load
Another    {:a}         (:b).unload  (restore :a)

This can be confusing. Refer to documentation of 'superset' on wikipedia
{:a}.superset?({:a,:b})

Something.superclass?(More)






definition of test classes where dataset usage is declared
running the tests, at which point we must extend the instances to have the data reading methods, creation methods
  during the run, the test methods should have access to the data that was created
