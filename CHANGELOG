*1.1.0 [STI, belongs_to] (February 14, 2009)

* STI is better supported for inserting, naming and finding records [aiwilliams]

  class Place < ActiveRecord::Base; end
  class State < Place; end
  class NorthCarolina < State; end

  create_record(NorthCarolina, :state)                        # no need to define the 'type' column value
  states(:state) == places(:state) == north_carolinas(:state) # read with the class names pluralized

* Moved to jeweler for much cleaner, github embracing gem building [aiwilliams]
* Support for simple belongs to associations

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base; end
  class Note < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :person
  end
  
  person_id = create_record Person, :myguy
  create_record Note, :person => :myguy
  Note.last.person_id == person_id

* Models inside modules are supported a little more conveniently [aiwilliams]

  module MList
    class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
    end
  end

  # We'll get rid of the underscore in 'm_list_messages'
  create_record MList::Message, :test
  mlist_messages(:test)
